Content to work with: ${textContent}

${customInstructions ? `CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS: You MUST incorporate these specific instructions into the script:
${customInstructions}

` : ''}WRITE A VOICEOVER SCRIPT that:

DURATION GUIDANCE: 
- Target approximately ${recommendedWords} words for optimal ${targetDuration}-second timing
- This ensures good pacing when read by ElevenLabs TTS (~2.8 words per second)
- Prioritize complete thoughts and clear explanations over strict word limits

CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
- Contains ONLY spoken content - no production instructions, visual cues, or stage directions
- Focuses on teaching the core concepts clearly and memorably
- ${stylePrompt.languageInstructions}
- Explains the main concept with clear examples or analogies
- Breaks down complex ideas into simple, digestible parts
- Maintains engagement throughout the entire duration

STYLE-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
${stylePrompt.styleSpecific}

DIALOGUE APPROACH REQUIREMENTS:
- ${dialoguePrompt.approach}
- ${dialoguePrompt.structure}  
- ${dialoguePrompt.techniques}

STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
- MINIMIZE intro fluff - jump quickly into educational content (max 1-2 sentences for intro)
- NO unnecessary ending summaries or outro phrases like "that's what they don't want you to know", "mind blown yet?", etc.
- Use sufficient time to thoroughly explain the concepts with concrete examples
- Break down ideas into digestible steps with specific details
- Balance education with engagement but prioritize substance over entertainment
- NEVER use em dashes. Use commas instead.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- ${stylePrompt.languageBalance}
- Ensure viewers actually LEARN something concrete and actionable
- Focus on clarity and understanding over pure entertainment
- MAXIMIZE educational content - don't waste words on unnecessary introductions or conclusions
- Include specific examples, facts, or practical applications
- NEVER include production notes like "cut to visuals", "show graphics", or similar instructions
- Write ONLY what the narrator will say out loud
- Complete your thoughts naturally - don't cut off mid-sentence for word count

Legacy Style Parameter: ${brainrotStyle}

AVOID THESE TIME-WASTING PHRASES:
- Long introductions like "What's up everybody, welcome back to my channel" 
- Unnecessary ending summaries like "Mind blown yet?", "That's what they don't want you to know", "Let's keep this convo going"
- Filler phrases that don't add educational value
- Generic conclusions or call-to-actions
- Repetitive transitional phrases

TIMING REMINDER: Aim for around ${recommendedWords} words, but prioritize educational value and natural flow over strict adherence to word count.`;
